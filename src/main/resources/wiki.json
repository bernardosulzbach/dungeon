      "content": "Bats are mammals whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. They are natural inhabitants of humid and quiet places, such as graveyards. The danger bats present in Dungeon varies according to the locations' luminosity. The darker the place is, more likely the bats are to hit and to critically hit. Engaging bats during daytime out in the open vastly increases the chance of success."

      "content": "Combat in dungeon is quite straightforward, issue 'kill' followed by the name of your target. Once in combat, all turns are simulated by the game engine.

Pressing TAB while the cursor is on the input field will either do nothing (if the command history is empty), get the last similar command to what is already on the text field (if there is one), or return the last command (if the text field is empty and there is at least one command on the command history)."

      "content": "This is a short tutorial to the World of Dungeon. Use \"commands\" to see a complete list of available commands. Use \"pick\" to grab something from the ground and \"kill\" to attack a target. In order to regain your lost hit points you can eat, rest or sleep. Only eating and sleeping will heal you up to your full health and sleeping can only be done at night."

      "title": "Fruit Bat",
      "content": "Fruit bats are not always large: the smallest species is just six centimeters long. The largest attain a wingspan of 1.7 meters, weighing up to 1.6 kilograms. Most have large eyes, allowing them to orient themselves visually in twilight and inside caves and forests. Their sense of smell is excellent. In contrast to other bats, fruit bats do not use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian fruit bat, which uses high-pitched tongue clicks to navigate in caves)."

      "title": "Green Iguana",
      "content": "The green iguana or common iguana is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana. Despite their name, green iguanas can come in different colors. They are diurnal, arboreal, and are often found near water. When frightened by a predator, green iguanas will attempt to flee, and if near a body of water, they dive into it and swim away. Agile climbers, iguanas can fall up to fifteen meters and land unhurt (iguanas use their hind leg claws to clasp leaves and branches to break a fall). During cold, wet weather, green iguanas prefer to stay on the ground for greater warmth. When swimming, an iguana remains submerged, letting its four legs hang limply against its side. They propel through the water with powerful tail strokes."

In order to use these skills, the character must issue the 'read' command targeting the desired tome, which must be in his or hers inventory.

      "title": "Time",
      "content": "Time passes after every turn. How much each turn lasts, however, depends on what the character did. Watches are used to keep precise track of time. Looking the time (using a watch) costs a little time, though. The character needs about four seconds to see what time it is in an equipped watch and around ten seconds to look up the time in a clock placed on his or hers backpack. A broken watch usually displays the time it broke. If the character is equipping a broken watch but has a working one in his or hers backpack, any attempt to look up the time will result in the character picking up the watch in his or hers backpack."
