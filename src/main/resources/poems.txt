TITLE:   A Coat
AUTHOR:  William Butler Yeats
CONTENT: \
I made my song a coat       \
Covered with embroideries   \
Out of old mythologies      \
From heel to throat;        \
But the fools caught it,    \
Wore it in the world’s eyes \
As though they’d wrought it.\
Song, let them take it      \
For there’s more enterprise \
In walking naked.

TITLE:   The road not taken
AUTHOR:  Robert Frost
CONTENT: \
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, \
And sorry I could not travel both    \
And be one traveler, long I stood    \
And looked down one as far as I could\
To where it bent in the undergrowth; \
Then took the other, as just as fair,\
And having perhaps the better claim, \
Because it was grassy and wanted wear\
Though as for that the passing there \
Had worn them really about the same, \
And both that morning equally lay    \
In leaves no step had trodden black. \
Oh, I kept the first for another day!\
Yet knowing how way leads onto way,  \
I doubted if I should ever come back.\
I shall be telling this with a sigh  \
Somewhere ages and ages hence;       \
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I  \
I took the one less traveled by,     \
And that has made all the difference.

TITLE:   To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time
AUTHOR:  Robert Herrick
CONTENT: \
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,      \
Old time is still a-flying;           \
And this same flower that smiles today\
Tomorrow will be dying.               \
The glorious lamp of heaven the sun,  \
The higher he's a-getting,            \
The sooner will his race be run,      \
And nearer he's to setting.           \
That age is best which is the first,  \
When youth and blood are warmer;      \
But being spent, the worse, and worst \
Times still succeed the former.       \
Then be not coy, but use your time,   \
And, while ye may, go marry;          \
For, having lost but once your prime, \
You may forever tarry.

TITLE:   A Dream Within A Dream
AUTHOR:  Edgar Allan Poe
CONTENT: \
Take this kiss upon the brow!  \
And, in parting from you now,  \
Thus much let me avow--        \
You are not wrong, who deem    \
That my days have been a dream;\
Yet if hope has flown away     \
In a night, or in a day,       \
In a vision, or in none,       \
Is it therefore the less gone? \
All that we see or seem        \
Is but a dream within a dream. \
I stand amid the roar          \
Of a surf-tormented shore,     \
And I hold within my hand      \
Grains of the golden sand--    \
How few! yet how they creep    \
Through my fingers to the deep,\
While I weep--while I weep!    \
O God! can I not grasp         \
Them with a tighter clasp?     \
O God! can I not save          \
One from the pitiless wave?    \
Is all that we see or seem     \
But a dream within a dream?

TITLE:   As The Sparrow
AUTHOR:  Charles Bukowski
CONTENT: \
To give life you must take life,                      \
and as our grief falls flat and hollow                \
upon the billion-blooded sea                          \
I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed     \
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures    \
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.\
Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow        \
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be     \
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.         \
I hated you when it would have taken less courage     \
to love.

AUTHOR: Dylan Thomas
CONTENT: \
Do not go gentle into that good night,              \
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;       \
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \
                                                    \
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,    \
Because their words had forked no lightning they    \
Do not go gentle into that good night.              \
                                                    \
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright       \
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, \
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \
                                                    \
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,     \
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,    \
Do not go gentle into that good night.              \
                                                    \
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  \
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,     \
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \
                                                    \
And you, my father, there on the sad height,        \
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\
Do not go gentle into that good night.              \
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

TITLE: In Flanders Fields
AUTHOR: John McCrae
CONTENT: \
In Flanders fields the poppies blow    \
Between the crosses, row on row,       \
That mark our place, and in the sky,   \
The larks, still bravely singing, fly, \
Scarce heard amid the guns below.      \
                                       \
We are the dead; short days ago        \
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  \
Loved and were loved, and now we lie   \
In Flanders fields.                    \
                                       \
Take up our quarrel with the foe!      \
To you from failing hands we throw     \
The torch; be yours to hold it high!   \
If ye break faith with us who die      \
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\
In Flanders fields.

Heaven is what I cannot reach!       \
The apple on the tree,               \
Provided it do hopeless hang,        \
That "heaven" is, to me.             \
                                     \
The color on the cruising cloud,     \
The interdicted ground               \
Behind the hill, the house behind, --\
There Paradise is found!

TITLE: The Raven
AUTHOR: Edgar Allan Poe
CONTENT: \
ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,              \
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,—                   \
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,              \
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.                  \
"'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;              \
    Only this and nothing more."                                            \
                                                                            \
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December                      \
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.             \
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow                  \
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore,                \
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:                \
    Nameless here for evermore.                                             \
                                                                            \
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain                \
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;             \
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating            \
"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,                 \
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:                   \
    This it is and nothing more."                                           \
                                                                            \
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,                 \
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;                 \
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,              \
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,                \
That I scarce was sure I heard you"—here I opened wide the door:—           \
    Darkness there and nothing more.                                        \
                                                                            \
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,     \
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;            \
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,              \
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"            \
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore:"             \
    Merely this and nothing more.                                           \
                                                                            \
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,               \
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.                   \
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;           \
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;                \
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore:                    \
    'T is the wind and nothing more."                                       \
                                                                            \
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,         \
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.               \
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;         \
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,              \
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:                   \
    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.                                     \
                                                                            \
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling                    \
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,—                 \
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,  \
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore:            \
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"            \
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \
                                                                            \
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,           \
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;                     \
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being                      \
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,               \
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,              \
    With such name as "Nevermore."                                          \
                                                                            \
But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only                \
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.              \
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,           \
Till I scarcely more than muttered,—"Other friends have flown before;       \
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."             \
    Then the bird said, "Nevermore."                                        \
                                                                            \
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,                  \
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,           \
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster                    \
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore:           \
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                     \
    Of 'Never—nevermore.'                                                   \
                                                                            \
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,                    \
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;     \
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking                   \
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,                  \
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore          \
    Meant in croaking "Nevermore."                                          \
                                                                            \
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing                  \
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;               \
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining                \
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,             \
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er            \
    She shall press, ah, nevermore!                                         \
                                                                            \
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer        \
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.             \
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!"                  \
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore."           \
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \
                                                                            \
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!         \
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,           \
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—                  \
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore:                    \
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"              \
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \
                                                                            \
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!          \
By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,              \
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,             \
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:                \
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore!"               \
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \
                                                                            \
"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting:  \
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!            \
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!           \
Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!                  \
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"       \
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \
                                                                            \
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting           \
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;                    \
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,            \
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor:       \
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor            \
    Shall be lifted—nevermore!

                                                \
and, if necessary, the windows—                 \
trees fifty, a hundred years old                \
out there,                                      \
heavy clouds on the way                         \
and the lawn steaming like a horse              \
in the early morning.
