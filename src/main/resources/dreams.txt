DREAM: You dream of a river of snakes. The snakes fly into the air, away from you.
DREAM: You have dreams of power, flowing out from books, and flying into your head.
DREAM: You have a nightmare about a tower burning endlessly through the night while laughter rings out.
DREAM: In your dreams, you see an orc stomping over two small rabbits.
DREAM: You dream about a man stronger than you staring you from the other side of a circular table. His grin terrifies you.
